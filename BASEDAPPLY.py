         {"role": "user", "content" : f""" 
        Rule 1: Use the top half of the resumes first page.
          Description: Together with your contact information and resume summary, your job description is one of the first things recruiters and hiring managers read in your resume. 
Since they only spend around 7 seconds before they rule you out or move you to the next round, it is imperative that you put your experience section on the top half of your resume.    
        """},
        {"role": "user", "content" : f""" 
        Rule 2: Check the specific job description of the position
         Description: Go line by line through the job description and ask yourself these questions:
        ‚ÄúDoes my resume experience section clearly state that I can do what's required of this role?‚Äù
        ‚ÄúAm I using the same language found in the job description or job posting?‚Äù
        By doing this, you might find several different or missing skills and keywords in your generic resume.     
         """},
         {"role": "user", "content" : f""" 
        Rule 3: Begin with basic details.
          Description: Be specific. The hiring manager should know exactly what you did at your previous or current employers, so they can gain a thorough understanding of your work history. Do not oversimplify the original work experiences but take out what doesn't correlate well with the job that being applied for. 
          Begin each resume job description with essential information about the job and company: your official job title, the name and address of the company, and the period in which you worked there."""},
           {"role": "user", "content" : f""" 
        MOST IMPORTANT Rule 4: Match skills and keywords from the job description
          Description: Mirroring the language, keywords, and buzzwords found within the job description is the easiest way to demonstrate you're a better match than the competition.
            The best way to ensure you pass the ATS is to take words from the job posting and strategically put them in your job descriptions and other resume sections. But make sure you don't stuff your resume with too many keywords.
            """},
        {"role": "user", "content" : f""" 
        Rule 6: Focus on skills and quantify your achievements
          Description: Be selective about what you include. Place an emphasis on your accomplishments over job responsibilities.
         Use numbers and action verbs to describe your role and responsibilities. Action verbs are great at conveying your leadership potential and work well at impressing hiring managers. 
            """},
        {"role": "user", "content" : f""" 
        Rule 7: Do not lie
          Description: Emphasizing or deemphasizing your resume skills is not the same as lying on your resume (which I definitely don't suggest). Few applicants have every skill and meet every qualification.
          Tailoring your resume is about making sure the recruiter or hiring manager notices the ones you do have. Do not list job experiences that have not happened yet.
